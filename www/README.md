## Notes

This project includes the following [PostCSS](https://github.com/postcss/postcss) plugins:

- [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com) - utility-first CSS framework
- [autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer) - plugin to parse CSS and add vendor prefixes to CSS rules using values from [Can I Use](https://caniuse.com).

To control the generated stylesheet's filesize, this example uses Tailwind CSS' [`purge` option](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/controlling-file-size/#removing-unused-css) to remove unused CSS.
